Problem identified :  In India, nearly 40% of food is wasted each year, while about 45% of tribal children suffer from malnutrition. Poor planning and gaps in the delivery system mean that food often does not reach those who need it, despite efforts by both nonprofit(NGOs) and government organizations. Our solution tackles these problems to ensure that no child goes hungry.

Solution proposed : 
The vision : The platform will act as a centralized hub where restaurants, farmers, and individuals can pledge surplus food or vegetables. NGOs like Goonj and Agragamee, which already work in tribal regions, can claim these donations through the platform and coordinate last-mile delivery using partners such as Indian Railways’ Kisan Rail or volunteer networks like the Robin Hood Army. Tribal communities, often in areas with limited internet access, can request aid via SMS or voice calls, with the platform translating these needs into actionable alerts for NGOs. Real-time tracking will allow donors to see their impact, from a vegetable crate leaving a Mysore kitchen to its arrival in a Sagarakatte village. 

Implementation methodology :
Tribal or slum people call the provided toll-free number where the call recording begins and captures all their needs. The recorded request is then submitted to the website, where it is first checked for any false requests before being listed for NGOs and donors to view.

NGOs or donors who are willing to help can accept the request, and in the subsequent step, they are allowed to upload proof of their support. Once the proof is uploaded, SMS notifications are sent to the tribal or slum people who originally made the request.

We are open to collaborating and partnering with NGOs in the future to streamline our process. Our page also features a donation section that allows users to donate. Unlike other donation pages, we display the donor's name, the donation date, the amount donated, and the specific cause for which the funds are used, building trust between us and the donors.

If an NGO is located far away and encounters transportation issues while supplying the needs, we support them by coordinating with other NGOs or donors. We strive to form a bridge of hope, ensuring that ‘No child goes hungry’.
